# Machine Learning Project: Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Machine Learning project focused on predicting heart disease. The project encompasses a complete machine learning pipeline, from initial data handling and exploration to the development, training, and evaluation of predictive models.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build and assess various machine learning models capable of predicting heart disease. The process includes essential steps such as:

* **Data Loading and Preparation**: Utilizing libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations. The project starts by loading a dataset, specifically 'train_heart.csv'.
* **Data Visualization**: Employing `matplotlib.pyplot` to visualize data characteristics and insights.
* **Model Development**: Implementing and training different machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
* **Model Evaluation**: Thoroughly assessing the performance of the trained models by examining key metrics such as accuracy, bias, and variance to understand their effectiveness and generalization capabilities.

All detailed methodologies, including data preprocessing steps, model architectures, training procedures, and the comprehensive results of the model evaluations, are meticulously documented within the `last_v2.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file. This notebook serves as the primary resource for a complete understanding of the project's execution and findings.
